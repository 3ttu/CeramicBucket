* **Unfired Clay Bucket**: Craftable with three clay balls.
* **Ceramic Bucket**: Craftable in furnace with an Unfired Clay Bucket.

The **Ceramic Bucket** acts like a normal bucket and can contain **water**, **lava**, **milk** and **fishes**.
The only difference is if the bucket contains lava, it melts as soon as you empty it.
